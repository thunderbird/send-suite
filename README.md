# ⛔️[DEPRECATED] Thunderbird Send Moved to -> [NEW REPO](https://github.com/thunderbird/tbpro-add-on/)

Thunderbird Send is an end-to-end encrypted file sharing solution, allowing you to safely encrypt, password-protect and send files through our [website](https://send.tb.pro/) or as an [add-on](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/tb_send/?src=search) for your Thunderbird Desktop application.

Currently, we are in a closed alpha state. Meanwhile, please join our [waitlist](https://tb.pro/) to try it out during our beta period, or feel free to follow the guide below to run a local or self-hosted version for yourself!

## Getting started

We migrate send to [our new repo](https://github.com/thunderbird/tbpro-add-on/)
